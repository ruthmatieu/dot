# Why I Chose this Tech Stack

1. React 19

- React recently released React 19. Choosing the latest version allows me to stay up to date with what's new in React and take an opportunity to put these new components to work such as useEffectEvent and modern ref handling.

2. TypeScript

- This is an industry standard. Typescript enables accurate typed context and clear intent in architecture.

3. Vite

- For a fas dev experience, simple configs.

4. React Router

- Used for explicit routing.

5. Local + Context + useReducer for state management
   Focusing on utilizing local, context and useReducer instead of Redux in order to provide myself with more fundamental practice.
6. TailwindCSS

- I prefer to keep styles within the component

7. ESLint + Prettier

- Industry standard.

8. React Testing Library
   Tests focus on behavior that would be most costly to break.
